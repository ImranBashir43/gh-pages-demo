# gh-pages-demo



This project demonstrates how to automatically deploy a static website to **GitHub Pages** using **GitHub Actions**.


Every time you push to the `main` branch, a GitHub Actions workflow is triggered. It copies your static files from the `src/` folder, moves them into a `public/` folder, and deploys the contents to the `gh-pages` branch using the [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) action.
